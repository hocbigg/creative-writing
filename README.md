# Summary

This curriculum is a complete, MOOC-based **Creative Writing major** equivalent to a traditional 4-year undergraduate program (minus general education not specific to the discipline). It builds a rigorous foundation in narrative craft, poetics, literary analysis, writing process, revision, and the professional habits needed by working writers.


## Organization

* **Intro Creative Writing**: Orientation, fundamentals, early craft, and testing long-form writing interest.
* **Core Creative Writing**: The main curriculum — fiction, poetry, nonfiction, narrative theory, form, and literary analysis.
* **Advanced Creative Writing**: Upper-division electives; students choose one concentration.
* **Final Project**: A capstone manuscript (short story collection, novel opening, poetry chapbook, or essay collection).


## Duration

**1–2 years**, assuming **~20 hours/week**.
Faster students may finish in ~12–16 months; others may take ~24 months.


# Skills Map

**Theory**

* Narrative theory (plot, character, point of view, time, perspective)
* Poetics: sound, image, line, form, rhythm
* Literary movements and historical context
* Genre conventions and experimentation

**Methods**

* Close reading
* Generative writing and drafting
* Peer workshop and critique
* Revision methodologies
* Research for creative nonfiction

**Tools**

* Manuscript formatting
* Story planning frameworks
* Revision logs
* Publishing tools (Submittable, Duotrope, etc.—optional)

**Practice**

* Weekly short exercises
* Multi-draft workshop pieces
* Long-form project development (novel chapters, essay series, or poetry sequence)


# Curriculum

## Roadmap

1. **English Foundations**
   Basic grammar and clear writing habits come first. This includes introductory courses that strengthen sentence-level skills and reading comprehension.

2. **Introductory Creative-Writing Craft**
   Once the fundamentals are steady, you move into the first layer of creative-writing craft: plot, character, and basic story/poem construction.

3. **Core Workshops and Theory**
   After the intro craft courses, you’re prepared for deeper work:

   * Fiction workshops
   * Poetry workshops
   * Creative nonfiction workshops
   * Narrative theory and formal structure
     These courses expand your understanding of how stories and poems actually work.

4. **Literary Analysis Courses**
   Alongside or after the core craft work, you take literature-analysis courses from Yale, Harvard, or similar sources. These teach how to read like a writer, interpreting technique and form at a high level.

5. **Genre and Form Electives**
   With both craft and analysis in place, you can move into thematic or genre-based courses (e.g., Poetry in America, Script Analysis). These deepen your sense of form, voice, and stylistic variation.

6. **Advanced Specialization Track**
   After the core and electives, you choose one advanced path:

   * Fiction and long-form narrative
   * Poetry and hybrid forms
   * Creative nonfiction and memoir
   * Digital and experimental writing
     Each track assumes you completed the earlier core craft courses.

7. **Capstone Manuscript**
   The capstone sits at the end of the entire sequence. It depends on all previous stages: foundational writing, narrative craft, workshops, analysis, and specialized study. The capstone requires both technical proficiency and a mature writing process.

## Intro Creative Writing

These courses build essential writing habits, test whether the student enjoys sustained creative work, and introduce the core forms (fiction, poetry, nonfiction).
