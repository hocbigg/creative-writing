# Summary

This curriculum is a complete, MOOC-based **Creative Writing major** equivalent to a traditional 4-year undergraduate program (minus general education not specific to the discipline).

It builds a rigorous foundation in narrative craft, poetics, literary analysis, writing process, revision, and the professional habits needed by working writers.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).
