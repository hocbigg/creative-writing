Path to a free self-taught education in Creative Writing! 

## 1) Program overview

**Learning goals & competencies (what you’ll be able to do after completing the program)**

* Write polished, publishable-quality short fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, and dramatic/scripted forms.
* Apply craft techniques: plot, scene, character, voice, style, imagery, prosody, pacing, revision.
* Critically analyze literary works and place your writing in historical/genre contexts.
* Run and participate in rigorous workshops (give and receive constructive feedback).
* Produce a portfolio (20–40k words of revised work + 10–15 polished poems or equivalent) and a defended capstone project.
* Learn practical publishing skills: query letters, submissions, small-press/agent mechanics, and basic digital promotion.

**Skills map — theory, methods, tools, practice**

* Theory: Literary forms & genre conventions; reading as craft analysis.
* Methods: Creative process, drafting & revision cycles, workshop protocols, peer review methods.
* Tools: Writing notebooks, version control for drafts (Git or Google Drive), reference managers (Zotero) for research, style guides, and manuscript formatting tools (Scrivener optional).
* Practice: Weekly writing exercises, sustained projects (short stories, sequences, a long short-form or novella), workshops, polished portfolio & capstone.

## 2) Plan & sequencing (1–2 years; sustainable ~20 hrs/wk)

Structure: **Orientation (6–8 weeks)** → **Core (12–14 months)** → **Advanced & Specialization (3–4 months)** → **Capstone (8–12 weeks)**. Courses are ordered; prerequisites are noted. MIT OCW courses are used wherever available; MOOCs fill gaps.

> Short legend: OCW = MIT OpenCourseWare (free, always available); Coursera/edX/Stanford = MOOC provider (self-paced / frequent runs). Links for main choices are cited after each course.

---

### Orientation (6–8 weeks) — test fit & build study habits (6–8 weeks, 8–10 hrs/wk)

Purpose: quick practical exposure to forms; build a sustainable weekly routine.

1. **MIT OCW — *Writing and Reading Short Stories*** — start here to try fiction. (Core intro; exercises; workshop model). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/week.
   * Why: concise intro with lecture notes & assignments; helps decide whether to pursue fiction track.
   * Assessments: weekly writing prompts, short stories, reading responses.

2. **MIT OCW — *Writing and Reading Poems*** — sample poetry craft. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][2])

   * Workload: 4–6 hrs/week.
   * Why: prosody fundamentals, short exercises—lets you decide on poetry vs prose.
   * Assessments: poem drafts, peer critiques (self-organize study group).

3. Quick habits mini-module (self-study):

   * Read: *On Writing Well* (William Zinsser) or free alternatives (online essays on craft).
   * Practice: daily 20–30 minute writing sprints; set/output goals for the program.

**Total orientation load:** ~10–14 hrs/wk; time left for light reading/community browsing to reach ~20 hrs/wk.

---

### Core (12–14 months) — foundational topics (roughly years 1–3 of an undergrad major)

Core is modular: **Fiction stream, Poetry stream, Nonfiction/Essay, Drama/Script, Literary Analysis & History, Revision & Editing, Publishing & Professional Practices**. You’ll take most core modules; choose distribution but ensure at least two genres (one primary + one secondary).

#### A. Fiction (foundational) — sequence (6–8 months)

1. **MIT OCW — *Writing and Reading Short Stories*** (if not completed in orientation) — repeat/workshop deeper. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/wk. Assessments: short stories, peer feedback.

2. **MIT OCW — *Fiction Workshop / Genre Fiction Workshop* (e.g., Fantasy or General Fiction)** — manuscript examples, assignments, peer workshop materials. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][3])

   * Workload: 8–10 hrs/wk. Assessments: longer story drafts, crits.

3. **Coursera — *Creative Writing Specialization (Wesleyan)*** — broken into craft modules (plot, character, setting, style). Strong, structured MOOC with peer review and graded assignments; self-paced enrollment available. Capstone: a substantial original story. ([Coursera][4])

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/wk per Coursera course. Assessments: peer-graded writing assignments, quizzes, capstone story.

**Why included:** MIT OCW supplies primary workshop material and readings; Wesleyan’s Coursera specialization provides structured craft modules and a capstone with peer review.

**Prereqs:** Orientation short stories course.
**Total Fiction load:** ~10–12 hrs/wk across modules while doing other cores in parallel.

#### B. Poetry (foundational) — sequence (4–6 months)

1. **MIT OCW — *Writing and Reading Poems*** (core). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][2])

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/wk. Assessments: weekly poems, close reading.

2. **Coursera/edX backup — *Poetry in America / Poetry workshops*** (search current offerings—many self-paced). (edX/edPortal list) ([edX][5])

   * Workload: 4–6 hrs/wk. Assessments: poem drafts, quizzes.

**Why:** MIT OCW gives prosody & practice material; MOOCs provide guided close readings and additional critique frameworks.

#### C. Creative Nonfiction & Essay (4–6 months)

1. **MIT OCW — *Writing and Reading the Essay*** (literary nonfiction & personal essay). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][6])

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/wk. Assessments: essays, revisions.

   * Workload: 6–8 hrs/wk. Assessments: scenes, one-act plays.

2. **MIT OCW — *Writing Science Fiction* or *Genre Fiction Workshop* for speculative/scripted formats*** (if you want genre drama). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][9])

3. **Textbook (if MOOC needed)**: *Screenplay* (Syd Field) or *Story* (Robert McKee) for screenwriting fundamentals (authoritative; paid). Free alternative: many screenwriting lectures on YouTube and sample scripts (use project resources).

#### E. Literary Analysis, Reading History & Context (6 months, concurrent)

1. **MIT OCW literature courses** (select relevant readings): e.g., *Shakespeare*, *Film Experience* for dramatic literacy. These strengthen analytic skills. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][10])

   * Workload: 4–6 hrs/wk. Assessments: close-reading essays, presentations.

2. **Coursera / edX**: *Masterpieces of World Literature* (HarvardX or other), *Modern & Contemporary American Poetry* (if available), and other literature MOOCs to round context. ([edX][11])

#### F. Revision, Editing & Publishing (2–3 months)

1. **MOOC / Self-study**: *The Craft of Style* modules (Wesleyan Coursera has *Craft of Style*). ([Coursera][12])

   * Workload: 4–6 hrs/wk. Assessments: editing exercises, stylistic revision.

2. **Professional practice**: short modules on submissions, query letters, and small-press mechanics (many free resources and recent blog posts; collect together as a course pack).

---

### Advanced (final-year style electives) — pick one concentration (3–4 months)

Choose **one** specialization and complete all its advanced courses to develop depth:

#### Specialization options (pick 1)

1. **Fiction: Novel & Long Form**

   * Coursera: *Write Your First Novel* (Michigan State or similar).
   * MIT OCW: advanced fiction workshop material and long-form project resources. ([Coursera][13])

2. **Poetry: Sequence & Performance**

   * Advanced MIT OCW seminar readings + Coursera/edX workshops on performance & craft.

3. **Creative Nonfiction & Memoir**

   * Wesleyan memoir courses + MIT essay materials.

4. **Dramatic Writing & Screenwriting**

   * Combine *Playwriting I* and screenwriting textbooks / MOOCs.

(Each advanced track includes sustained project work and reading lists.)

---

### Final Project (Capstone) — 8–12 weeks

**Deliverable choices (pick one primary):**

* A short story collection (20–30k words, 6–8 revised stories) **or**
* A novella (30–50k words) + portfolio of short works **or**
* A poetry manuscript (10–15 polished poems + sequence) **or**
* A dramatic script (one-act play or feature script) + production plan **or**
* Creative nonfiction book-length proposal + 30k sample.

Capstone components: proposal, annotated bibliography/reading list, 1-page synopsis, midterm draft (50% complete), final draft, reflective artist’s statement (1,000–1,500 words), and a submission plan (targeted journals/presses). Peer review + public presentation.

---

## 3) Alternatives & resilience

**Backup options for key courses**

* MIT OCW *Writing & Reading Short Stories* backup: **Coursera — Creative Writing Specialization (Wesleyan)** for structured modules and peer review. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])
* MIT OCW *Poems* backup: **edX / Coursera poetry courses** and *Modern & Contemporary American Poetry* (when available). ([edX][5])
* Playwriting backup: **Stanford Continuing Studies / other university continuing ed (live, paid)**. ([continuingstudies.stanford.edu][14])

**Catch-up modules (gaps in academic skills)**

* Academic writing & research methods: **edX — English Composition / Academic Writing** or MIT OCW writing fundamentals. (If you’ve not taken college-level writing, take an academic writing MOOC first.) ([MIT OpenCourseWare][15])
* Grammar & style: *The Elements of Style* (Strunk & White) — paid book; free alternatives exist (Project Gutenberg excerpts, online grammar resources).
* Close reading & lit theory: MIT OCW literature modules (Shakespeare, Film) and HarvardX literature offerings. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][10])

**How to audit / access materials for free**

* **MIT OCW**: always free, no signup. (All core MIT courses cited are OCW pages.) ([MIT OpenCourseWare][15])
* **Coursera & edX**: most content is visible for free in audit mode (videos & readings). To earn certificates you pay; peer-graded assignments often require enrollment. Coursera often allows full audit with limited peer grading—use the audit for learning and replicate peer feedback via local study groups. ([Coursera][13])

---

## 4) Study process & checkpoints

**Weekly routine (20 hours/week — sample week)**

* **Monday (3.5 hrs)** — Watch/Read: 2 lecture videos (1.5–2 hrs); take smart notes (Cornell or Zettelkasten).
* **Tuesday (4 hrs)** — Writing sprint: 2×45min sprints + read assigned texts (2 hrs).
* **Wednesday (3.5 hrs)** — Close reading & craft analysis (read 1–2 short pieces; annotate).
* **Thursday (4 hrs)** — Drafting (new material or revision pass).
* **Friday (2 hrs)** — Peer review / discussion forum engagement; respond to others’ drafts.
* **Saturday (2 hrs)** — Workshop prep: polish piece for weekly workshop; meta reflection/ spaced repetition (review notes).
* **Sunday (1 hr)** — Weekly reflection and plan next week.

Adjust time to match course workload. Use Trello/Notion to track tasks and deadlines.

**Checkpoints (every 8–12 weeks)**

* **Week 8**: Diagnostic — write a 1,500–2,000 word piece + short critical apparatus (one-page commentary on craft choices).
* **Week 16**: Mid-program portfolio: 6 short pieces (stories/poems/essays) + peer feedback log. Instructor-style rubric applied.
* **Week 24**: Long project milestone: first full draft of capstone 50% complete + annotated reading list.
* **Final checkpoint** (capstone): submission-ready manuscript + project defense writeup.

**Portfolio artifacts (concrete outputs)**

* Weekly: short exercise drafts (organized in folders).
* Every 12 weeks: polished collection (3–6 pieces) with revision history.
* At program end: capstone manuscript + 1,000–1,500 word artist’s statement + submission plan.
* Ancillary: annotated bibliography (20–30 titles), reading notes, critique reports (how you edited based on feedback).

1. *The Art of Memoir* — Mary Karr.
2. Free alternative: MIT OCW essay course readings plus public essays.

---

## Practical tips, communities & auditing

* **Forums & peer groups**: Use Coursera forums while enrolled; create Slack/Discord study groups for weekly workshops. Join writing communities (r/writing, local Meetup groups, Scribophile).
* **How to audit**: On Coursera/edX choose *audit* mode to access videos/readings; simulate peer review by swapping drafts with 3–4 study partners if peer grading is behind paywall. ([Coursera][13])

---

## Final notes & next steps (how to begin in the next 2 weeks)

1. Start **Orientation**: open MIT OCW *Writing & Reading Short Stories* and *Writing & Reading Poems* pages and skim syllabi/assignments. (Links above). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])
2. Set a weekly schedule (I gave a sample 20-hr plan). Create a Trello/Notion board for tasks, deadlines, and the capstone plan.
3. Recruit a 3–5 person workshop group (Discord/Slack/Reddit) to mirror course workshops—this substitutes for paid peer grading.
4. Pick your specialization by month 3 and follow the advanced track.
